# Path PC CARLA/V2X

Treat this file as an operating procedure, not proof of current state. Re-run the read-only baseline before every intervention.

## Safety boundaries

- Work locally when already on `path-B860I-AORUS-PRO-ICE`; do not SSH back into the same host.
- From another host, use the configured SSH/Tailscale connection to `path@100.72.252.40`. Do not embed credentials in commands or source.
- Make source changes only in a clean Codex worktree. Use `/home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend-dev` as the clean reference.
- Do not overwrite `/home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend` until a controlled deployment gate. It may run active services and contain live-only work.
- Preserve `/home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend-backups/` and take a fresh rollback snapshot before deployment.
- Never use the retired `carla-rfs`/CARLA 0.9.16 restart recipe. The accepted simulator is RR/CARLA 0.10.
- Before service or tunnel changes, stop every mutation-capable timer in the maintenance window, snapshot its state, and restore it only after validation:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop \
  v2x-drive-link-health.timer \
  v2x-perception-link-health.timer \
  v2x-hourly-drive-restart.timer
```

The link-health units can repair/publish public runtime configuration when their independent repair and release gates are enabled. The hourly unit restarts CARLA/drive and may publish tunnel configuration when explicitly enabled.

## Revalidate the live topology

Observed on 2026-07-10; verify rather than assume:

| Layer | Expected live value |
|---|---|
| CARLA container | `carla-rr-maps` |
| CARLA image | `ghcr.io/simforgeinc/carla-rr-maps:0.10.0` |
| CARLA command | `./CarlaUnreal.sh -RenderOffScreen -vulkan -nosound -carla-rpc-port=2000` |
| CARLA runtime/network | NVIDIA runtime, Docker bridge, host ports `2000-2002` |
| Map | `Richmond_Field_Station_Richmond_CA` |

| Drive WebSocket | `0.0.0.0:8765`, `v2x-drive.service` |
| Frontend | Vite on `0.0.0.0:5173`, `v2x-web.service`; do not inject browser-local `VITE_DRIVE_WS_URL` |
| Perception | `0.0.0.0:8090`, `v2x-perception.service` |
| Perception Python | `/home/path/V2XCarla/perception-venv/bin/python` (observed Python 3.12.3) |
| Perception assets | ignored live `apps/perception/yolov8n.pt` plus `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/mobilenet_v3_small-047dcff4.pth`; hash and preserve both |
| Drive tunnel | `v2x-cloudflared-drive.service`; currently Quick Tunnel unless a named-tunnel gate has completed |
| Perception tunnel | `v2x-cloudflared-perception.service`; currently Quick Tunnel unless a named-tunnel gate has completed |
| Public API | `https://w0j9m7dgpg.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com` |
| AWS deploy caller | `arn:aws:iam::147229569658:user/rfs-v2x-service`; API writes require the dedicated least-privilege deploy role |
| Amplify repository | reconcile stale `michaelvu1207/v2x-backend` to canonical `path2v2x/v2x-backend` with a fresh token and explicit release gate |

## Mental model

Keep these layers separate:

1. CARLA RPC on `2000`.
2. Drive WebSocket bridge on `8765`.
3. Supervised frontend dev server on `5173`.
4. Perception health/MJPEG on `8090`.
5. Independently supervised Drive and perception tunnels.
6. Cloudflare or Tailscale transport.
7. Public runtime configuration and API routes.

A healthy CARLA container does not prove a healthy bridge, tunnel, frontend, or perception pipeline.

## Drive diagnosis order

1. Confirm `carla-rr-maps` is running with the expected image/command.
2. Confirm CARLA 0.10 accepts a client and has the Richmond map loaded.
3. Confirm `v2x-drive.service` and listener `8765`.
4. Perform a WebSocket handshake/protocol health check.
5. Inspect the tunnel process and its local origin.
6. Compare public `/config.json` and `/drive-config` with the active tunnel.
7. Refresh `/drive` and capture visible state, console, network, and WebSocket evidence.

CARLA client probe:

```bash
/home/path/V2XCarla/carla-venv-310/bin/python - <<'PY'
import carla

client = carla.Client("127.0.0.1", 2000)
client.set_timeout(20.0)
print("client", client.get_client_version())
print("server", client.get_server_version())
print("map", client.get_world().get_map().name)
PY
```

WebSocket handshake probe:

```bash
/home/path/V2XCarla/carla-venv-310/bin/python - <<'PY'
import asyncio
import websockets

async def main():
    async with websockets.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8765", open_timeout=10):
        print("WS_OK")

asyncio.run(main())
PY
```

Useful logs:

```bash
journalctl -u v2x-drive.service --utc -n 200 --no-pager
journalctl -u v2x-cloudflared-drive.service --utc -n 200 --no-pager
journalctl -u v2x-drive-link-health.service --utc -n 200 --no-pager
tail -n 200 /tmp/v2x-cloudflared.log
```

## Tunnel and runtime configuration

- The current installed drive unit may launch a process-scoped Quick Tunnel to `http://localhost:8765`.
- A named hostname such as `wss://drive.path2v2x.net` is valid only after its credential, DNS, unit, and WebSocket handshake are independently proven.
- Never hardcode a newly observed `*.trycloudflare.com` URL in source.
- Never roll back to a saved Quick-Tunnel URL after that process has stopped; it is dead. Preserve the old tunnel during a blue/green cutover, publish the newly proven endpoint, verify public convergence, and only then stop the old process.
- Treat Tailscale and Cloudflare as separate transports. Validate the endpoint the browser actually selected.

Read-only checks:

```bash
pgrep -af cloudflared
curl -fsS https://path2v2x.net/config.json | jq .
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  https://w0j9m7dgpg.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/drive-config
```

An HTTP `426` from the tunnel root can be expected for a reachable WebSocket-only origin. Require a real WebSocket `101`/handshake for acceptance.

## Perception diagnosis

Do not use HTTP `200`, MJPEG byte flow, or a rising republished-frame counter as freshness proof. The service can replay `last_valid_frames` while an upstream camera is frozen. The tracked event timestamp is Path-PC decoded-frame receipt time; it proves local capture freshness and monotonic upload time, not upstream Kinesis transport latency.

Check producer timestamps twice and require all four channels to advance:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8090/health | jq .
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8090/detections/latest | jq .
sleep 5
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8090/detections/latest | jq .
```

Expected endpoints:

- `/health`
- `/detections/latest`
- `/streams/ch1.mjpg` through `/streams/ch4.mjpg`

Validate upstream Kinesis separately through the read API:

```bash
for camera in ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4; do
  curl -fsS \
    "https://w0j9m7dgpg.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/video/session/${camera}" \
    | jq '{cameraId,playbackMode,expiresIn,hlsUrlPresent:(.hlsUrl|length>0)}'
done
```

Never print or retain signed HLS query strings. For acceptance, require:

- ch1-ch4 decoded-frame capture timestamps remain recent and advance;
- real frames change, not only response bytes;
- event timestamps are monotonic and close to DynamoDB ingestion time;
- forced HLS expiry/reconnect recovers within the agreed bound;
- socket counts do not accumulate `CLOSE_WAIT`;
- a new DynamoDB record proves current event and ingestion timestamps.

Useful logs:

```bash
journalctl -u v2x-perception.service --utc -n 300 --no-pager
journalctl -u v2x-cloudflared-perception.service --utc -n 200 --no-pager
journalctl -u v2x-perception-link-health.service --utc -n 200 --no-pager
ss -tanp | awk 'NR==1 || /python/ || /CLOSE-WAIT/'
```

Use the tracked dependency-light verifier for the four-feed gate, locally and
again through the browser-selected public perception origin. It requires two
advancing health/detection samples and two different complete JPEG hashes from
each feed, and rejects query-bearing endpoint input:

```bash
/home/path/V2XCarla/perception-venv/bin/python \
  /home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend/apps/perception/tools/verify_live_feeds.py \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

For a bounded Drive/twin/replay regression, run the tracked verifier observationally first. Use `--apply` only after it reports zero active sessions; the apply mode creates two isolated sessions, verifies correlated Teleport, exercises replay, restores live mode, and cleans up owned actors in `finally`:

```bash
/home/path/V2XCarla/carla-venv-310/bin/python \
  /home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend/apps/bridge/tools/verify_phase4_live.py
/home/path/V2XCarla/carla-venv-310/bin/python \
  /home/path/V2XCarla/v2x-backend/apps/bridge/tools/verify_phase4_live.py --apply
```

## Controlled deployment gate

Before changing live services:

1. Confirm the clean worktree commit and successful web/bridge/perception tests.
2. Confirm no active drive session.
3. Stop both repair timers and the hourly restart timer.
4. Capture installed unit hashes, process commands, container image ID, live Git status, tunnel/runtime config, ignored-model/cache hashes, perception Python/pip state, and service logs.
5. Preserve rollback copies of installed units, ignored runtime assets, and the live repository changes.
6. Let `v2x-carla-rr.service` adopt an already-running validated container through `docker wait`; do not restart or recreate it merely to add supervision.
7. Install one layer at a time and refresh UI/API evidence after each action.
8. Start perception with `/etc/v2x-perception.env` keeping `V2X_PERCEPTION_UPLOAD=false`; require four fresh/changing feeds before enabling production uploads and proving a current DynamoDB record.
9. Restore the previous artifact immediately when its acceptance gate fails. For Quick Tunnels, restore variables around the currently healthy endpoint, never a dead saved URL.
10. Re-enable timers only after the final public/runtime checks pass.

API route reconciliation is plan-first and exact-resource only. The normal service user cannot write API Gateway directly. A separately authorized principal must apply `infra/aws-cli/bootstrap-v2x-deploy-role.sh`; then assume `V2XBackendDeployRole` and run `provision-read-api.sh` with the reviewed API ID, `RECONCILE_LAMBDA=false`, IAM attachment disabled, explicit `PLAN_ONLY=false`, and the plan's `EXPECTED_CURRENT_STATE_HASH`. Do not add API privileges to the Amplify service role.

Prefer source-controlled scripts and systemd units over one-off `nohup` or manual Docker commands. Do not leave source that exists only in the live checkout.
